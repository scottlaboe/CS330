I learned a lot of new things with this project. Understanding how to write low-level graphics code for openGL has been a really interesting experience which has greatly increased my interest in 3D graphics from very little to something that I will continue to improve. I was surprised by how much versatility you are afforded with shaders. Another thing I learned was how to use Blender. I had used blender in the past for simple things like wrapping text around something I modeled in cad, so it was nice to learn more about how to use some of those tools.

Some questions and topics I'd like to explore are adding different material characteristics to the model structs so I can achieve more interesting results in the shader. I initially thought I could bake the glass texture into the object so it would seem like it was transparent, but I quickly realized this was impossible because any change in perspective results in a complete breakdown of the model's presentation. For this reason, the process needs to be dynamic and implemented in the shader.

There are some applications at work, where blender will be useful, but I expect my interest in writing code leveraging openGL will reside as a curiosity until I've expanded my understanding and ability to something that is saleable.
